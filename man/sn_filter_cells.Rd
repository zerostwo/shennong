\title{Filter cells in a Seurat object based on QC metrics}
\usage{
sn_filter_cells(
  x,
  features,
  group_by = NULL,
  method = "mad",
  n = 5,
  plot = TRUE,
  filter = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A Seurat object}

\item{features}{Character vector of metadata column names to use for filtering}

\item{group_by}{(Optional) Metadata column name to group by for group-wise calculations}

\item{method}{Outlier detection method (currently only "mad" supported)}

\item{n}{Numeric threshold(s) for MAD multiplier. Can be single value or vector matching features.}

\item{plot}{Logical indicating whether to generate QC diagnostic plots}

\item{filter}{Logical indicating whether to filter out flagged cells}
}
\value{
Seurat object with QC flags in metadata. If filter=TRUE, returns subsetted object.
}
\description{
This function filters cells in a Seurat object using Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)
to identify outliers across specified metadata features. Supports grouped analysis and provides
visual diagnostics.

# Basic usage
pbmc <- sn_filter_cells(pbmc, features = c("nCount_RNA", "nFeature_RNA"))

# Grouped analysis
pbmc <- sn_filter_cells(pbmc, features = "percent.mt", group_by = "sample")

# Custom threshold with plotting
pbmc <- sn_filter_cells(pbmc, features = "nCount_RNA", n = 3, plot = TRUE)
}
