\title{Filter genes based on the number of expressing cells}
\usage{
sn_filter_genes(x, min_cells = 3, plot = TRUE, filter = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A Seurat object.}

\item{min_cells}{An integer specifying the minimum number of cells in which a gene must be expressed to be retained. Default is 3.}

\item{plot}{Logical; if TRUE, a bar plot is generated showing the number of remaining genes at different filtering thresholds. Default is TRUE.}

\item{filter}{Logical; if TRUE, returns the filtered Seurat object. If FALSE, returns the original object. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A filtered Seurat object if `filter = TRUE`, otherwise the original object.
}
\description{
This function filters genes in a Seurat object based on the number of cells in which they are expressed.
Optionally, it can visualize the effect of different filtering thresholds.
}
\details{
The function computes the number of cells expressing each gene in the Seurat object and filters out genes
expressed in fewer than `min_cells` cells. If `plot = TRUE`, it visualizes the effect of filtering using `ggplot2`.
}
\examples{
library(Seurat)

# Load example Seurat object
pbmc_small_filtered <- sn_filter_genes(pbmc_small, min_cells = 5, plot = TRUE, filter = TRUE)
