# Shennong Maintainer Status

Last updated: 2026-07-15

## Current structure

- CodeGraph is initialized and synchronized for the repository's R, Python, and
  workflow source. The current index is used for symbol discovery and call-path
  review; Markdown, Rmd, Rd, data, and TOML still require exact text search.
- Package-maintainer documentation is indexed by `docs/codex/README.md`.
  Historical prompts, plans, audits, and long status logs are archived under
  `docs/codex/archive/`.
- Communication and regulatory activity implementations are separated into
  `R/analysis_communication.R` and `R/analysis_regulatory.R`.
- Repository benchmarks live together under `benchmarks/`. Development smoke
  scripts live under `scripts/smoke/` and are not installed with the package.

## Latest cleanup

- Work is active on `feat/analysis-publication-roadmap` against the
  `shennong_analysis_and_publication_figure_roadmap.md` specification.
- Milestone A now has a shipped method registry, availability diagnostics, and
  a common analysis-result schema with generic store/get/list/delete/validate
  APIs. Existing registered result collections are upgraded compatibly rather
  than copied.
- Milestone B1 now has the unified annotation API, marker/reference consensus,
  SingleR/CellTypist/Seurat/Symphony/scmap/scANVI adapters, confidence and
  runner-up calibration, hierarchical labels, a versioned Cell Ontology
  mapping, low-confidence review, and three result-aware diagnostic plots.

- Removed internal helpers that had no callers and removed the now-unused
  `data.tree` and `later` dependencies.
- Consolidated three overlapping Codex design notes into `Governance.md`.
- Hardened the pre-push build path so temporary tarballs/check directories are
  cleaned and source-package contents are audited for local CodeGraph or plot
  artifacts.
- Preserved all pre-existing 2026-07-02 SCTransform `block_genes` source,
  documentation, skill, and test changes.
- Preserved the merged grouped-dotplot coordinate fix and the
  minimal-dependency vector fallback for feature plots without `ggrastr`.
- Aligned the pending data-server integration with the installed ShennongData
  0.2 client contract.
- Declared `msigdbr` in the pkgdown workflow's explicit website dependency
  list so the feature-annotation vignette can execute on a clean CI runner.
- Marked the CITE-seq WNN template as non-executing because the article does
  not construct or ship the required multimodal `pbmc_cite` input object.

## Validation

- Annotation workflow tests currently pass with
  `FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 1 | PASS 39`; scmap is the single skip because the
  optional package is not installed locally. SingleR and Symphony CPU paths run
  against deterministic synthetic query/reference objects.
- `scripts/check-prepush.R --filter=annotation-workflow --quick` passes the
  annotation tests, source build, tarball audit, structural R CMD check, and
  pkgdown reference-index validation with `Status: OK`.
- The complete pkgdown site was rebuilt from an installed copy of the current
  source; the expanded annotation article and all eight new reference pages
  rendered successfully.
- The Milestone A result/registry plus interpretation compatibility tests pass
  with `FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 142`.
- pkgdown was rebuilt from an installed copy of the current source; the new
  analysis-method/result-contract article and all existing references rendered
  successfully.
- `scripts/check-prepush.R --filter=analysis-registry-result --quick` passed
  its targeted tests, source build, tarball audit, structural
  `_R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_=false R CMD check`, and pkgdown reference-index
  validation with `Status: OK`.
- `devtools::document()` completed and updated regulatory Rd source pointers
  after the module split.
- Focused tests for signatures, communication/regulatory activity,
  interpretation, visualization, and shipped Codex skills passed with
  `FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 308`.
- The full local suite passed with
  `FAIL 0 | WARN 1 | SKIP 5 | PASS 1429`. The warning is the known tiny-input
  enrichment `qvalue` fallback; skips are for unavailable optional packages.
- The temporary-source pre-push build completed, and its tarball-content audit
  confirmed that `.codegraph`, `Rplots.pdf`, and the development smoke script
  were absent. The structural `R CMD check` completed with `Status: OK` after
  the CI compatibility fixes.
- The complete pkgdown site rebuilt successfully with the local pkgdown template
  override.
- CodeGraph re-synced successfully at 65 indexed files, 1,091 nodes, and 3,015
  edges; the new regulatory module is discoverable and the removed helper names
  have no exact source occurrences.
- PR #4 passed `R-CMD-check`, `test-coverage`, and both Codecov statuses before
  merging into `main`.
- Post-merge pkgdown deployments exposed a missing website-only `msigdbr`
  installation and an unseeded CITE-seq example after a transient jsDelivr SSL
  failure; both reproducibility fixes are being validated on GitHub Actions.

## Deferred local data

Ignored `dev/outputs/` and benchmark input/run caches contain several gigabytes
of untracked data and scripts. They were not deleted automatically; see
`Roadmap.md`.
